# Typeracer Autotyper
Autotyper for typeracer. Works just as the name implies.

Note: I do not condone cheating. This was just a mini project I did while messing around with python libraries. All testing was done in a private Typeracer lobby.
Use at your own discretion.

# Dependencies / Libraries Used
This project uses the Pillow Library to capture images and the Tesseract/Pytesseract to read the text on the images.\
Pyautogui is used to type out the words.
